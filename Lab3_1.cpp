//Design, implement, and test a class which represents a rational number . The 𝑛/𝑚 , 𝑚 ≠ 0
//class should provide methods which implement simple arithmetic operations on rational
//numbers (e. g. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Implement addition and
//subtraction as standard member methods and multiplication as well as division as friend
//functions. In the main() function write the code that demonstrates the use of the class.
